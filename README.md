## Features

- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead for efficient communication.
- **Secure**: Utilizes X25519 for key exchange and AES-GCM for encryption.
- **Pluggable Transport**: Easily integrate different transport protocols.
- **Generic Addressing**: Flexible addressing for various communication scenarios.
- **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: Direct communication between peers without intermediaries.
- **Embedded Systems**: Designed with resource-constrained environments in mind.

## Getting Started

To get started with SecureStream, you can check the [Releases](https://github.com/KaushikGarkoti/SecureStream/releases) section for the latest version. Download the appropriate file and execute it to begin using SecureStream in your projects.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following before starting:

- .NET SDK (version 5.0 or higher)
- Basic understanding of cryptography concepts
- Familiarity with networking principles

## Installation

To install SecureStream, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KaushikGarkoti/SecureStream.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd SecureStream
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

4. Add SecureStream to your project via NuGet:

   ```bash
   dotnet add package SecureStream
   ```

5. Ensure all dependencies are installed and the project compiles successfully.

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example to demonstrate how to use SecureStream in your application.

### Setting Up a Secure Connection

```csharp
using SecureStream;

public class SecureConnectionExample
{
    public void Start()
    {
        var connection = new SecureConnection();
        connection.Initialize();
        
        // Perform handshake
        connection.Handshake();

        // Send data securely
        var dataToSend = "Hello, Secure World!";
        connection.Send(dataToSend);
        
        // Receive data securely
        var receivedData = connection.Receive();
        Console.WriteLine($"Received: {receivedData}");
    }
}
```

### Key Concepts

- **SecureConnection**: This class manages the secure communication.
- **Handshake**: Establishes a secure connection using X25519.
- **Send**: Sends encrypted data over the established connection.
- **Receive**: Receives encrypted data and decrypts it.
